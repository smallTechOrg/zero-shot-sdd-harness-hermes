# Zero Shot SDD Harness for Building Agents

Give it a one-line idea. Walk away with a working, tested, phased agent.

A lean, Claude-Code-native harness for building agentic software **spec-first**. One person with an idea and one API key can drive a real, production-shaped agent into existence — and a senior engineer opening the result finds a conventional, reviewable stack, not generated mush.

---

## The Spirit

Six convictions the whole repo is built around:

1. **Spec is the source of truth.** The spec is written before the code, always. When spec and code disagree, the spec wins and the code is fixed (`/zero-shot-sync`). Every AI session reads the same requirements instead of re-deriving them.
2. **Built for two audiences at once.** A non-coder drives it with a single sentence; a senior engineer inherits a clean FastAPI + LangGraph stack they can read, review, and own. Neither audience is an afterthought.
3. **Lean harness, not a framework.** `harness/` is engineering *mindfulness* — rules and patterns that keep every session consistent — deliberately Claude-Code-only and kept small. The product runtime stays provider-agnostic; the harness does not.
4. **Smallest first-time-right win, phase by phase.** Each phase ships the smallest increment a human can actually test, and it must work the *first* time they test it — real on the tested path, with clearly-labelled stubs for everything still to come. No rough edges on the path you're handed.
5. **A human gates every phase.** The build is autonomous *within* a phase and stops at each boundary for you to test the increment. You stay in control of what "done" means.
6. **Real LLM/API or it doesn't count.** Gates, tests, and evals run against the real model with keys from `.env`. A stubbed pass is not a pass.

## What This Is

A starting point for building AI agents spec-first. The repo ships with:

- A working **baseline agent** in `src/` (FastAPI + LangGraph + SQLite, provider-agnostic LLM — Anthropic or Gemini, `transform_text` as the capability slot) — tests pass out of the box
- A **spec template** in `spec/` covering roadmap, architecture, capabilities, data model, API, UI, and agent graph
- Three **zero-shot skills** (`/zero-shot-build`, `/zero-shot-fix`, `/zero-shot-sync`)
- A four-agent **team** — agent-builder orchestrates (plans, fans out, owns git/PR); spec-writer is the single design authority; code-generator implements one slice per instance (parallelised); qa-auditor reviews and gates
- Engineering rules and patterns in `harness/` so every Claude Code session is consistent
- **Human testing gate between phases** — autonomous within a phase, you test each increment before the next starts

## How to Use This

### Step 1 — Clone

```bash
git clone https://github.com/smallTechOrg/zero-shot-sdd-harness.git my-agent
cd my-agent
```

### Step 2 — Open in Claude Code

```bash
claude
```

### Step 3 — Build

```
/zero-shot-build An agent that monitors my Shopify store for low-inventory products and drafts restock emails to suppliers
```

One intake round (scope, stack, API keys → fill `.env`), then the agent builds phase by phase and stops at each boundary for you to test.

## What Happens (Intake → Phase by Phase)

```
Your idea
    ↓
INTAKE — scope, stack, LLM provider, constraints; fill .env with the required API key
    ↓
[spec-writer]  → Full spec: architecture + agent-graph + phased plan (self-reviewed)
    ↓
[agent-builder] → Feature branch + PR, scaffold
    ↓
per phase — all slices concurrently:
    [code-generator: slice-a]  ──→  [qa-auditor: slice-a]  ─┐
    [code-generator: slice-b]  ──→  [qa-auditor: slice-b]  ─┤→  commit + push
    [code-generator: slice-c]  ──→  [qa-auditor: slice-c]  ─┘
    ↓
HUMAN TESTING GATE — exact run commands + expected result; you confirm before next phase
    ↓
(issue → qa-auditor classifies SPEC-vs-CODE → code-generator fixes → re-gate)
    ↓
repeat per phase → SHIP
```

Phase 1 is the smallest first-time-right win — real on the tested path, with labelled stubs for everything coming later. Each later phase wires one more stub into real functionality.

## Repo Layout

```
src/                ← baseline agent (FastAPI + LangGraph + SQLite, Anthropic/Gemini)
  api/              ← FastAPI routers (create_app, health, runs)
  config/           ← Pydantic BaseSettings
  db/               ← SQLAlchemy models + session
  domain/           ← Pydantic request/response models
  graph/            ← LangGraph nodes, edges, state, runner  ← CAPABILITY SLOT
  llm/              ← LLM client + providers/ (anthropic, gemini)
  prompts/          ← prompt templates (.md)
  observability/
frontend/           ← Next.js static export (served by FastAPI at /app)
tests/
  unit/             ← passes with no API key
  integration/      ← requires real key in .env
spec/               ← your spec: roadmap, architecture, capabilities/, data, api, ui, agent

  rules/            ← ai-agents, git, secret-hygiene
  patterns/         ← spec-driven, phases, project-layout, tech-stack, code, test-driven, ui-ux, agentic-ai, engineering-practices
.claude/
  skills/           ← /zero-shot-build, /zero-shot-fix, /zero-shot-sync
  agents/           ← agent-builder, spec-writer, code-generator, qa-auditor
CLAUDE.md
pyproject.toml
alembic.ini        ← Alembic migrations (alembic/)
agent.py            ← verify setup (default); --run to start the server
.env.example
```

**Capability slot** — the three files to replace for your agent:
- `src/graph/nodes.py` — replace `transform_text` with your logic
- `src/prompts/transform.md` — replace with your system prompt
- `frontend/src/app/page.tsx` — replace the transform form with your UI

Everything else (graph wiring, API, DB, settings, tests) is already working.

## Running the Baseline

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# edit .env: set exactly ONE provider key —
#   AGENT_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=<your key>   or   AGENT_GEMINI_API_KEY=<your key>
# the provider is auto-detected from whichever key is set
uv sync
python agent.py                        # verify tools, .env, deps, tests (default)
python agent.py --run                  # migrations + frontend build + start server
```

Once running:

| URL | What |
|-----|------|
| `http://localhost:8001/app/` | **UI** — transform form (the capability slot) |
| `http://localhost:8001/health` | API health check |
| `http://localhost:8001/docs` | Interactive API docs (Swagger) |

Tests:

```bash
uv run pytest tests/unit/ -v          # no key needed
uv run pytest tests/ -v               # requires real key in .env
```

## Rules AI Agents Follow

Full rules in `harness/rules/ai-agents.md`. Summary:

- Read the full spec before writing any code
- Never skip a phase; commit every logical unit
- Tests run against the real LLM/API using keys from `.env` — stubbed runs do not count as passing
- Each phase is tested by the human before the next phase starts
- The build record is git history + the PR + the per-phase test-handoffs

## FAQ

**What if I already have a stack in mind?**
State it in the idea: `/zero-shot-build [idea] — use Python + FastAPI + PostgreSQL`. Stack choices are binding.

**What if something breaks?**
Run `/zero-shot-fix [what's broken]` — qa-auditor classifies the problem (SPEC vs CODE), the right generator fixes it, qa-auditor re-gates.

**What if spec and code drift?**
Run `/zero-shot-sync` — qa-auditor classifies each divergence, generators fix, spec wins.
